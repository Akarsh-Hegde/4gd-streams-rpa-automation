Opening the Clearance Desk- ImageRight

	•	Establishing the RDC connection if Image Right is not connected. 

	•	Refresh the clearance box by locating the "To Do List" tab in ImageRight. Click on the following steps:
	•	Workflow -> UW_NEWBUS - Manual Process, verify if these are default values
	•	Step -> NEW_ACCT_SUBMISSION - Manual Process,  verify if these are default values
	•	User -> Unassigned - Manual Process,  verify if these are default values
	•	Click -> Fetch

	•	Noting effective date and priority. 
	•	Manual process to prioritise the files -> Prerequisite: Arrange the "Effective Dates" in ascending order and compare the "Priority" under the TO DO list. (Step 3a to Step 3c)
	•	Once the Clearance Box is sorted by submissions that were sent to InstyQuote@riscomins.com (Priority 1) on the top in red, further sorted by the time the submission was initiated/time it arrived. 
	•	Below the Instys will be the submissions sent to Clearance@riscomins.com (Priority 5), also sorted by the time they arrived. 
	•	Select and open EACH submission as they come in. You will need to fetch the Clearance Box every time you come back to it/after processing each submission. This is to make sure you have the most current submissions showing in the box, and can identify Instys as they arrive. 
	•	Sometimes, you will find an Insty that was sent to Clearance@riscomins.com. You will need to change the priority to Priority 1 on these, when you go to mark the Effective Date. 
	•	The same goes for when an agent sends a submission to InstyQuote@riscomins.com. If it is a true non-Insty per the application, you will need to readjust the priority to 5. 
	•	Special Note  -> a UW can request ANY submission to be an Insty. They know the specifics of their file, and may be in a rush for the submission for any reason. 
	•	Manual Process for us to verify-> An agent, however, can never request a submission to become an Insty if it’s outside of the 2 weeks. 

	•	Open the submission by double clicking on the line or right click and select open file.
Instead of double click or right click, we click on Auto Process (automation process).


	•	Check the application's Information page for the effective date. 
	•	Manual Process to verify -> Note: If the ACORD form does not have the Effective Date, we need to check if it’s mentioned in the Email.

	•	Go to the card information (located in the left side of the ImageRight viewer) and double click "No Description". Be sure that both tasks in the line below are highlighted. Right click and click on "Change.
	•	Manual Process to verify -> “Task” can be left as is and “No Description” must be changed to “Effective Date”
	•	Priority--> Enter Effective Date on description line--> mark priority 1 if Insty/ priority 5 if not. Click "ok".



	•	Once the submission is marked with the effective date in the box, and all Insty (if any) are identified, its time to begin processing a submission.
	•	Remember:
	•	Instys (Priority 1) are to be processed by effective date order.
	•	Non-Insty (Priority 5) submissions are to be processed in the order in which they are received. (Why: Agents who submit applications for an insured are accepted on a first come, first served basis).
	•	Manual Process to verify -> Check the Effective Date (prioritised based on ascending order)
	•	Once you select the first submission you need to work on, right click the file and select “Autoprocess Selected Tasks.”

	•	The below window will pop up. Click anywhere in the ImageRight viewer so this window goes behind ImageRight for later. We will pull this window back up towards the end of processing the submission.

	•	To begin ordering pages in IR, lets start with the images. Select any images that are just supporting images to an email signature etc. If you find pictures of units, buildings, products, etc., do not delete these.
	•	Identify and label the main pages of the application. This would be your INFO page and LOBs.


	•	To begin moving the pages to where they belong, start with the correspondence. Highlight the email and drag it to ANY yellow folder, EXCEPT the top yellow folder with the TEMP #.
	•	A pop-up will appear titles "File Information." Click "Change Document Types" and scroll and find the appropriate folder. Refer to the Special Notes: Page Order Checklist to know where specific items are to be dropped in.

Search Insured - IMS
	•	Checking the RDC connection.
	•	Search all the insured names and DBA if any against the Do Not Quote (DNQ) List.
	•	The Do Not Quote list is found in the shared drive under S:\Underwriting\DO NOT QUOTE
	•	The list is updated periodically so use the most recent list.
	•	If an insured name appears on the list see Special Notes - Do Not Quote List for further processing instructions. Example:

Do Not Quote List

The Do Not Quote List is a reference guide for the UW to be used in identifying accounts that may not be a fit for our program based on past underwriting concerns as noted by senior management.
The underwriter will not pursue quoting the account without approval from senior management for this reason. If we do receive a submission for an insured whose name on the list, follow the below steps:
	•	Process the submission as normal then
	•	Add a File Note to the UW
	•	Send an email to the UW with cc to UW Mangers email group
	•	The file should be large, red, bold type and state the following:
“THIS RISK IS ON THE DO NOT QUOTE LIST - SENIOR MGT APPROVAL REQUIRED TO QUOTE”
	•	Type the File Note > Highlight the Text > Right Click > Character

	•	Size: 18 > Attributes, check: Bold > Color: Red > OK



   

	•	Send the UW an email with a cc to UW Managers email group to let them know
1. SIGNATURE FOR DO NOT QUOTE LIST:
Clearance received a submission for the above-named insured, and set it up under Control #XXXXXX.
The insured is on our DO NOT QUOTE list.
	•	No need to end the task. Leave the submission in “Submitted” status.

	•	Cross Referencing Steps:
	•	Open up the application and search Insured Name (DBA, and any other named insureds), Phone #, Address and FEIN
	•	You’ll find this information on the INFO page
	•	You will need to check all insured names
	•	Tip: Start with a truncated/shorter version of the insured name/address. This way it will pull any similar names/addresses as well, if any. For PO Boxes, just search for “Box #”
	•	You will not always have all the above-mentioned information, or be able to match all of it against IMS. Sometimes only some info matches a couple different insureds. This is where learning to use an educated process of elimination to determine if the current insured (the application) is indeed a match for an insured pulling in IMS.
	•	Tip: If you need further verification, you can take a look at drivers, units, description of business, or contact info.
	•	Tip: If you find other insureds in IMS with matching information, minimize their insured window to remind you later to make a file note of the similarities you found.
	•	Example: Look up Magnetite Works LLC in IMS > Open card > Go through the Cross- Referencing steps above, then take a look at the File Note in Control #182115 to know how to notate Similar Matches and Possible Relations
	•	New Insured, New Submission, New Quote and Renewals follow the below instructions.
	•	New Insured
	•	None of the application information pulls any insured in IMS

Effective Date Rules
	•	If the effective date is already past the current date, or is the current date, then set the effective date 7 days out from current date
	•	If the agent forgot to change the effective date to the current policy year, check your correspondence too just in case they mentioned the effective date there. It could be in the subject line or in the body of the email. Whether it is listed in correspondence or not, verify that it’s indeed an updated application as best as you can, and make the best educated decision you can. File note that the date has a discrepancy, and what you set it as vs. what the app says.
	•	If you receive two effective dates (application says one, and correspondence says another), always go by what’s on the application, but file note the discrepancy.
	•	90 Day Rule: If a submission is received on an account where the effective date has passed but it's still within a 90 day window, enter the submission as normal but send the below e-mail to each underwriter notifying them that 2 submission have been received within the 90 day time period. See below:

SAME Submission Received within 90 days from the effective (past effective date): (Underwriters)
A second submission has been received from (list second agency) for the same insured already in IMS for (current agency). The effective date has already past on the first submission in but the second submission effective date falls within the 90 day rule. Please discuss between each underwriter to determine which submission to decline and let the agent know.

	•	Also on Pg. 2, under “Premises Information” you can sometimes find an agent listed a description there. Generally, you’d only use the description for the first location, if applicable.

	•	Correspondence. A lot of times the agents will tell the UW the nature of the business there. 
	•	Narratives, when supplied.
	•	If there is a GL, MTC, or GARAGE LOB with the application, you can sometimes find a description there.

Autoprocessing

	•	BE sure the card just created is selected in ImageRight when begin processing; NOT the TEMP file.
	•	Enter the control number just created. Hit the tab key on keyboard – Insured name should fill in.
	•	If it does not fill in, or the name doesn’t match the application just processed, the wrong control number was entered and must be fixed.
	•	Be sure "Document Type" says Misc – Misc.
	•	Folder: Prior to Binding – Prior to Binding/Correspondence – Correspondence.
	•	Task Priority: 1 (Insty) or 5 (Non-Insty).
	•	If UW sent a submission to InstyQuote, but the effective date is not within the Insty two week period, mark the Priority as 5 here.
	•	It’s okay for a UW to request that a submission be processed in Insty time, but that does not make the actual submission a true “Insty” – hence why it will need to be marked as a Priority 5 here.
	•	Send to User: Insert the UW for this file
	•	Resume > Update > Release

	•	The next popup window, select Yes to go back to the Clearance box, and No to not.
